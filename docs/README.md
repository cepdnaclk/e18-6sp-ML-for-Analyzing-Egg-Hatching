## Introduction

Our domain encompasses the entire spectrum of poultry farming, focusing on the critical aspects of hatching success and chick health. Poultry farms play a pivotal role in meeting the global demand for eggs and poultry products. Our platform recognizes the challenges faced by farmers in optimizing their breeding programs, improving productivity, and ensuring the well-being of their flocks.

Within a poultry farm, various factors come into play to achieve successful hatching and raise healthy chicks. This includes careful management of breeder chickens, including their housing, nutrition, and healthcare. The selection and collection of high-quality eggs from these breeders are essential, as they serve as the foundation for incubation and subsequent chick development.

The incubation process itself is a critical phase, where specialized incubators provide the ideal environment for embryo development. Precise control of temperature, humidity, and ventilation ensures optimal conditions for the eggs to hatch successfully. During this period, close monitoring of embryo development is crucial to identify any issues or complications that may require intervention.Incubation is indeed a longer process that typically spans 21 days for most poultry species. During this period, eggs require dedicated space, resources, and continuous monitoring. When an egg fails to hatch at the end of the incubation period, it represents a waste of valuable incubation space, as well as the electricity and resources invested in maintaining the optimal incubation environment.

## Problem and Solution
The poultry industry faces significant challenges when it comes to the hatching process in breeder farms. Poultry farmers invest considerable resources and effort into incubating eggs, but the outcomes are often uncertain and unpredictable. This unpredictability leads to inefficiencies, economic losses, and compromised animal welfare. Additionally, the lack of accurate predictions regarding the number of eggs that will successfully hatch and the health of the resulting chicks hinders the ability of farmers to make informed decisions and optimize their breeding programs. Consequently, there is a pressing need to address these challenges and improve the overall hatching success rate in the poultry industry.

We are going to offer a promising solution to the challenges faced by the poultry industry by predicting successful hatching eggs. By harnessing the power of machine learning algorithms, we can analyze a wide range of influential factors such as the age of parent chickens, feed amount, sex ratio and environmental conditions. These factors are crucial determinants of hatching success.

Through our project, we develop predictive models that can accurately forecast the number of eggs that will hatch successfully and predict the likelihood of producing healthy chicks. By leveraging historical data and identifying patterns and correlations, our models provide valuable insights to poultry farmers. Armed with this information, farmers can make data-driven decisions, optimize their breeding programs, and implement necessary interventions to maximize hatching success and chick health.
